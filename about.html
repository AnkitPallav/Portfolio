<p>"Hello, I'm <b>Ankit Pallav</b>, and I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from School of Engineering, CUSAT, Kerala. I'm genuinely passionate about engineering, and I see it as more than just a field of study; it's a way of thinking and problem-solving that I find incredibly exciting.

  What truly drives me is my insatiable curiosity and eagerness to learn. I believe that engineering is not only about mastering the technical aspects but also about creative problem-solving and innovation. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and push my boundaries.
  
  I'm also a firm believer in the power of self-expression. Whether it's through my engineering projects, written articles, or even art, I enjoy finding unique ways to communicate ideas and concepts. It's my way of making the technical world of engineering more accessible and relatable to others.
  
  I'm thrilled to be part of this dynamic and innovative community of engineers, and I'm always open to new collaborations and ideas. So, if you'd like to discuss engineering, innovation, or just have a good chat about anything under the sun, feel free to reach out. Let's learn and express ourselves together!"</p>
