They got to know each other through an exchange of letters and slowly fall in love. One day, Jaidev receives a letter informing him that Smriti had died by an accident. Now his sister Karuna is the only support system that keeps him motivated. One day Jaidev finds an unconscious girl near a lake and brings her home.
